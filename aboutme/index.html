    <h2>Austin Allred</h2>
    <p>I currently live in Pasco, Washington, but have lived in California, Oregon, and North Carolina too. I'm currently deciding between pursuing web development or programming for my major. I'm hoping that this class, along with the other classes I'm taking this semester can help me. One of the things I love most about BYU-Idaho is that it allows me to explore a lot of courses from the comfort of home and allows for a flexible schedule.</p>
    <p>I have quite a few hobbies. I love to read both classical and fantasy novels. My favorite author is Terry Pratchett and my favorite book by him is "Hogfather", but "Guards! Guards!" is another great one. I also like playing DnD with my friends. I'm currently part of two weekly games, one where I'm the DM and one where I'm a player. I also like listening to music. I don't have a favorite genre, but a lot of my songs tend to be pop music.</p>
