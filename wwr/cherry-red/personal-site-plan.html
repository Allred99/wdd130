      <h3>Artificer</h3>
      <p>
        [Glassblower
        These artificers work with glass. Many of these artificers focus on creating eyewear or other products. 
        
        
        3RD LEVEL: EYEWEAR
        You can spend 1 hour and 15sp worth of materials to create eyewear for a specific creature. A creature wearing this eyewear gains a bonus to Investigation and Perception checks that rely on sight equal to half your proficiency bonus (rounded down). A creature can only benefit from wearing one piece of eyewear at a time. 
        
        
        3RD LEVEL: GLASSBLOWER SPELLS
        You always have certain spells prepared when you reach specific levels in artificer, as shown in the table below. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells that you prepare. 
        You can cast Heat Metal on glass as well as metal and you can cast the spell as a bonus action. When you cast this spell on a weapon from your Glass Weaponry feature, the weapons deal additional fire damage equal to the fire damage dealt by the spell, but you do not take any fire damage from holding the weapon.


3RD LEVEL: TOOL PROFICIENCY
At 3rd level, you gain proficiency with glassblower’s tools. If you are already proficient with glassblower’s tools, you can choose one other type of artisan’s tools to become proficient in. Additionally, you can turn sand into glass with your glassblower’s tools.


6TH LEVEL: EXTRA ATTACK
You can attack twice, rather than once, whenever you take the attack action.


6TH LEVEL: GLASS WEAPONRY
You learn how to create weapons made of glass. As an action, you can expend a spell slot to create one simple melee weapon that deals slashing damage. You can make a weapon this way as long as you have at least one hand free. The glass weapon will appear in your hand. The weapon you create is considered magical and deals additional slashing damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Whenever you land a weapon attack roll with a glass weapon that you made with this feature, you can immediately use a bonus action to cause the weapon to shatter. The weapon instantly breaks and the creature you attacked takes an additional 3d6 slashing damage. The glass weapon can last for up to 1 minute or until it is shattered.


10TH LEVEL: ARMOR OF GLASS
You learn the Armor of Agathys spell. However, instead of frost, shrapnel glass coats the outside of your armor and gear. A creature that hits you with a melee attack takes slashing damage from the spell instead of cold.


14TH LEVEL: GLASS STORM
You're now able to conjure a storm of burning shards of glass. Once per long rest, you can cast Incendiary Cloud at 8th level without using a spell slot. When you cast the spell using this feature, a creature that fails the Dexterity saving throw is also Blinded for the next minute. They can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of their turns to end the Blinded condition early.

Pyrotechnician
A pyrotechnician focuses on the chemical processes behind fireworks, gunpowder, and other processes.


3RD LEVEL: HAND MORTAR
You create a hand mortar: a portable firearm with a short barrel to launch special fireworks that you make.
Each firework that you make for this feature costs 10sp of materials and takes 15 minutes to produce. As an action, you can launch the firework and make it explode a maximum distance of 120 ft. away. All creatures in a 30 ft. radius of the explosion must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failure, creatures take Xd6 fire damage (where X is your Intelligence modifier, minimum 1). On a successful saving throw, they take half the fire damage. 
You can apply additional effects to your firework by spending more money in its construction:
Radiant. All creatures in a 30 ft. radius of the firework must make a Constitution saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw,  the creatures suffer Xd4 radiant damage (where X is your Intelligence modifier, minimum 1) and are Blinded until the end of their next turn. On a successful saving throw, they only take half of the radiant damage. You must spend an additional 10sp when constructing your firework to give it this effect.
Thundering. All creatures in a 30 ft. radius of the firework must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed saving throw, the creatures suffer Xd4 thunder damage (where X is your Intelligence modifier, minimum 1) and are Deafened until the end of their next turn. On a successful saving throw, they only take half of the thunder damage. You must spend an additional 5sp when constructing your firework to give it this effect.


3RD LEVEL: PYROTECHNICIAN SPELLS
You always have certain spells prepared when you reach specific levels in artificer, as shown in the table below. These spells count as artificer spells for you, but they don’t count against the number of artificer spells that you prepare. 

3RD LEVEL: TOOL PROFICIENCY
You gain proficiency with alchemist’s supplies. If you are already proficient with alchemist’s supplies, you can choose one other type of artisan’s tools to become proficient in.


6TH LEVEL: FLAMING MISSILES
You learn the Magic Missile spell if you don’t know it already. It doesn’t count against the number of artificer spells you have prepared. Whenever you cast the spell, each dart deals additional fire damage equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1). Once per long rest, you can cast the spell without expending a spell slot.  


10TH LEVEL: SHOWMAN’S FINESSE
Whenever an ally would have to make a saving throw because of ammunition made from your Explosive Weaponry feature, or one of your Pyrotechnician spells, they can add your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) to their saving throw.


14TH LEVEL: GRAND FINALE
Once per long rest, you can choose to double the damage a firework from your Hand Mortar feature deals.
