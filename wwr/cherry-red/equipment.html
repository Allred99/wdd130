            <h2>Unconventional Weapons</h2>
            <p>These weapons are rarely used on the battlefield. However, in the right hands, they can be highly effective. You won't find them in any armory, but you might find them as old heirlooms or as items sold in a trinket shop. To be proficient with these weapons, you must have the Weapon Specialty feat for their weapon group.</p>
            <h2>Range</h2>
            <p>A weapon’s range dictates how far away you can be from your target when making an attack. To make a ranged attack without disadvantage, you must be at least 10 ft. away from the target (and any other hostile creatures) and within the listed range.</p>
            <p>Making a ranged attack against a creature while within 5 ft. of the target, within 5 ft. of a hostile creature, or beyond the weapon’s listed range is at disadvantage. The maximum range that you can attempt to hit a creature from with a ranged attack with the weapon is equal to twice the weapon’s range (this is considered to be long range for feats such as the Weapon Specialty: Bow Weapons feat).</p>
            <p>For example, because a dagger’s range is 30 ft., attacking a target that is 30 ft. away is rolled as normal. If a creature tried throwing a dagger beyond the range (up to 60 ft.), the attack roll would be at disadvantage.</p>
            <h2>Special Property</h2>
            <p>You must be proficient in a weapon to use its Special property.</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Arm Blades. A pair of blades that are tied to your forearm to slash at foes. If you wear one arm blade on each of your arms, your AC is increased by a total of 1. While wearing these weapons, you cannot wield a shield, use any weapons with the two-handed property, or use the versatile property of a weapon.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Boomerang. When you take the attack action with this weapon, you can also choose to expend your bonus action. When you do, you make two attack rolls instead of one per attack- but both rolls must be against the same creature. The first attack is the boomerang going away from you and the second one is as it returns to you. However, you do not add your Strength or Dexterity modifier to the damage roll on the second (returning) attack. Immediately after the second attack, it returns to your hand- allowing you to use it again if you can. So, if you have the Extra Attack feature, you make four attacks instead of two as your Attack action</p></li>
                <li> <p>Brass Knuckles. Whenever you make an unarmed attack and hit a foe, you can choose to add this weapon's damage dice to your damage roll.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Kusarigama. Once per turn, when you hit a Large or smaller creature with this weapon, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed saving throw, the creature is pulled to an unoccupied space adjacent to you.</p> </li>
                <li> <p>Lacerating Ribbon. Instead of using your Strength or Dexterity modifier for this weapon's attack and damage rolls, you can choose to use your Charisma modifier instead.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Serrated Handfan. A durable, ornate handfan with bladed edges. As a bonus action, you can attempt to use the fan to create a gust of wind and blow a Medium-sized or smaller creature within 10 ft. of you. That creature must make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexteiryt modifier (minimum 1)). On a fialed saving throw, the creature is forced 10 ft. back and knocked Prone. On a successful saving throw, they're only forced 5 ft. back.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Yo-Yo. Once per turn, when you hit a Large or smaller creature with this weapon, you can force that creature to make a Strength saving throw (DC 8 + your Strength or Dexterity modifier + your proficiency bonus). On a failed saving throw, the creature is pulled to an unoccupied space adjacent to you.</p></li>
