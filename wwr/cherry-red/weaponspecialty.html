        <h1>Weapon Specialty Feats</h1>
        <p>Whenever a Weapon Specialty feature mentions your weapon’s damage dice, it only refers to the dice that you roll for that weapon (as listed on the weapons table and with weapon scaling). For example, the weapon damage dice of a Flametongue Dagger that deals 1d4 piercing + 2d6 fire would refer only to the 1d4 (if the wielder was at least level 5, this would become 2d4 because of weapon scaling).</p>

            <h2>Weapon Specialty: Axe Weapons</h2>
            <h3>1st Level Feat</h3>
            <p>You are well-trained with weapons in the axe group (battlaxe, greataxe, handaxe). You gain the following benefits based on your level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Level 1: Graze. If you make an attack roll with a weapon in this group and you miss, you deal damage to the creature equal to the ability modifier you used for the attack roll (minimum 0). This damage is the same type as the weapon's.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 1: Slasher. When you hit a creature with a weapon in this group, the creature's movement speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the end of their next turn. A creature can only be affected by this once per turn.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 3: Vex. When you hit a creature with a weapon in this group, you have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature until the end of your next turn.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 5: Rampage. Once per turn, if you score a critical hit or reduce a creature's hit points to 0 with a weapon in this group, you can make one additional attack as part of your attack action.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 7: Reaper. Once per turn, when making a melee attack with a weapon in this group, you can attempt to hit a second creature with the same attack, provided that the second creature is in range of your weapon and the creature would be hit by the initial attack roll. For example, if there are two enemies in your weapon's range with 12 AC and you rolled a 16 on your initial attack roll, both creatures are hit by the attack.</p></li>
            </ul>

        <section class="body_p" id="ws-bow">
            <h2>Weapon Specialty: Bow Weapons</h2>
            <h3>1st Level Feat</h3>
            <p>You are well-trained with weapons in the bow group (longbow and shortbow). You gain the following benefits based on your level:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <p>Level 1: Critical Shot. Whenever you land a critical hit with a weapon in this group, you can double your Dexterity modifier for the damage roll.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 1: Slowing. Whenever you hit a creature with a weapon in this group, the creature's movement speed is reduced by 10 ft. until the end of their next turn. A creature can only be affected by this once per turn.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 3: Farsight. Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls that you make with a weapon in this group.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 5: Precision Attack. Once per turn, when you make an attack with a weapon in this group, you can give yourself advantage on the attack roll.</p></li>
                <li> <p>Level 7: Swift Strike. Once per turn, when you land a critical hit with a weapon in this group, you can make one additional attack as part of your attack action.</p></li>

                <li> <p>Level 3: Vex. When you hit a creature with a weapon in this group, you have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature until the end of your next turn.</p></li>
