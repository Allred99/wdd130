        <h2>6th Level: Auric Blast</h2>
        <p>You learn how to manifest your aura to blast your foes. As an action, you can make two ranged spell attacks- each with a range of 60 ft. You are proficient with it and you add your Wisdom modifier to its attack and damage rolls. On a hit, a creature suffers force damage equal to two rolls of your Martial Arts die.</p>
        <h2>10th Level: Empowered Mood</h2>
        <p>The range of your Mood Boost feature doubles to 30 ft. and the benefits of your Mood Boost feature double. For example, a creature gains a d12 inspiration die if you choose blue and a creature’s damage is reduced by double your Wisdom modifier if you choose magenta. If you choose orange or indigo, and the creature is currently Frightened (orange) or Charmed (indigo), you can end the condition.</p>
        <h2>10th Level: Surging Aura</h2>
        <p>Whenever you roll initiative, you gain a number of temporary hit points equal to your monk level. These temporary hit points last 1 minute.</p>
        <h2>14th Level: Forced Empathy</h2>
        <p>You learn to alter a creature’s life energy to mimic the injuries of others. Once per short or long rest, as a reaction, when a creature within 30 ft. of you takes damage, you can use your reaction to choose another creature within 30 ft. of you feel the same pain that they did. The chosen creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC is 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier. If the creature fails, they lose the same amount of hit points as the other creature did. On a successful saving throw, the creature only loses half the hit points that the other creature lost.</p>
